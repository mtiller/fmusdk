  <h1>FMU SDK 1.0</h1>
  The FMU SDK is a free software development kit provided by
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de" target="_blank">QTronic</a>.
    The FMU SDK demonstrates basic use of Functional Mockup Units (FMUs)
    as defined by the 
    <a href="http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/fmi.html" 
        target="_blank">FMI Specification 1.0</a>.
    A short overview on FMUs and the FMI specification can be found
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmi_overview.pdf" taget="_blank">here</a>.
    The FMU SDK can also serve as starting point for developing applications 
    that create or process FMUs.
    <p>
    The FMU SDK contains the C sources for various discrete and continuous 
    FMU models, a batch file for compiling and zip'ing these models, 
    an XML parser for parsing the model description of an FMU and a simple 
    simulation program that runs a given FMU and outputs the result as CSV file.
    <p>
    The FMU SDK can be downloaded from 
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip">
        http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip</a>. 
    For bug reports, questions or comments regarding the FMU SDK, please
    mail to <a href="mailto:fmu@qtronic.de">fmu@qtronic.de</a>.
    Questions or comments regarding the FMU specification should be sent to

<h2><a name="installation">Building and Installing the FMU SDK</a></h2>
Downwload the FMU SDK from <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/products/fmusdk.zip">here</a>, 
and unzip in a directory where you have write access. 
That directory is called FMUSDK_HOME below and may contain white space, such as in "C:\Program Files\fmusdk". 
The FMU SDK contains only the C sources of the FMUs an the simulator, not the executables, 
and should compile on all Windows platforms.
<p/>
To build the FMUs and the simulator, double click on FMUSDK_HOME\source\build_all.bat.
This should create files FMUSDK_HOME\fmu\*.fmu and the simulator FMUSDK_HOME\bin\fmusim.exe. 
Compilation using build_all.bat requires that you have installed 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (VS8) or 2008 (VS9), for example the free Express Edition. 
To compile with another compiler, adapt file build_all.bat.
<hr />
<h2><a name="simulation">Simulating an FMU</a></h2>
To run one of the FMUs in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu, open a command shell in directory
FMUSDK_HOME and run the command fmusim 
<pre>
fmusim model.fmu tEnd h loggingOn csvSeparator
  model.fmu ..... path to FMU, relative to current dir or absolute, required
  tEnd .......... end  time of simulation, optional, defaults to 1.0 sec
  h ............. step size of simulation, optional, defaults to 0.1 sec
  loggingOn ..... 1 to activate logging,   optional, defaults to 0
  csvSeparator .. column separator char in csv file, optional, defaults to ';'
</pre>
This unzips the given FMU, parses the contained modelDescription.xml file, simulates
the FMU from t=0 to t=tEnd, and writes the solution to file 'result.csv'. The file
is written in CSV format (comma-separated values), using ';' to separate columns and
using ',' instead of '.' as decimal dot to print floating-point numbers.
To change the result file format, use the 'csv separator' option.
The logging option activates logging of the simulated FMU. The FMI specification does
not specify, what exactly to log in this case. However, when logging is switched on,
the sample FMUs of the FMU SDK log every single FMU function call. Moreover, the
fmusim simulator logs every step and every event that is detected.
<p/>
Example command:
<pre>
&gt; fmusim fmu/bouncingBall.fmu 5 0.1 0 ;
FMU Simulator: run 'fmu/bouncingBall.fmu' from t=0..5 with step size h=0.1, loggingOn=0, csv separator=';'
Simulation from 0 to 5 terminated successful
  steps ............ 51
  fixed step size .. 0.1
  time events ...... 0
  state events ..... 14
  step events ...... 0
CSV file 'result.csv' written
</pre>
To plot the result file, open it e.g. in a spread-sheet program, such as Miscrosoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc.
The figure below shows the result of the above simulation when plotted using OpenOffice Calc 3.0.
Note that the height h of the bouncing ball as computed by fmusim becomes negative at the contact points, 
while the true solution of the FMU does actually not contain negative height values. 
This is not a limitation of the FMU, but of fmusim, which does not attempt to locate the 
exact time of state events. 
To improve this, either reduce the step size or add your own procedure for state-event location to fmusim.

<h2><a name="creating_fmus">Creating your own FMUs</a></h2>
The FMU SDK contains a few sample FMUs
<ul>
    <li><a href="../source/dq/_main.html">dq</a> the Dahlquist test function x = -k der(x)</li>
    <li><a href="../source/inc/_main.html">inc</a> increments an integer counter every second</li>
    <li><a href="../source/values/_main.html">values</a> demonstrates the use of all scalar FMU data types</li>
    <li><a href="../source/bouncingBall/_main.html">bouncingBall</a> a bouncing ball that defines state events</li>
</ul>
To implement your own FMU using the FMU SDK, create a directory - say xy - in FMUSDK_HOME\source, and create
files modelDescription.xml and xy.c there. 
The names of the new directory and the .c file must be the same. The content of the .c file should 
follow the existing FMU examples, see the comments in the example code. 
When done with editing the xml file and xy.c, open a command shell in FMUSDK_HOME\source 
and run the command <code>build_fmu xy</code>. 
This should create the FMU file xy.fmu in directory FMUSDK_HOME\fmu.
